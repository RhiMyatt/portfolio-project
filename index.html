  <p>As a teacher, there are quite a few things I'm excited to bring with me to coding:</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>An enthusiasm for learning new subjects.</li>
    <li>Working with like-minded people to create new masterpieces.</li>
    <li>Taking what I learn about coding and helping others learn it in turn.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>There's More To Say</h3>
    <p>After graduating from college, I worked for CPS with Elementary School students, who's ages ranged from six to fourteen. I love work students, but I've also come to find that I love the creativity that comes with designing webpages and creating codes!</p>

  <p>Thinkful has given me a wonderful opportunity to branch out and combine my interests and passions in new, exciting way!</p>
